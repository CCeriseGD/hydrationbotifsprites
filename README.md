this is just sprites for a minigame im adding to a bot

ignore this ig, tho you may find some use in this crap ton of sprites
(the filenames are md5 hashes of the names of the files in the infinite fusion sprite pack)
(the ones in the "new" folder are both normal and shadow sprites, the shadow sprite names are the md hash of s + the file name)
